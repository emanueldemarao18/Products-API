# PRODUCTS API

I'm developing a product API with all the essential features for efficient catalog management. Here's a brief overview of the main characteristics:

CRUD Operations:

Create: I add new products to the system, including details such as name, description, price, and stock quantity.
Read: I enable the retrieval of detailed information about existing products, making it easy to query for characteristics and availability.
Update: I provide the ability to modify details of existing products, such as price, stock quantity, description, etc.
Delete: I allow the removal of products from the system when necessary.
Testing:

I implement unit and integration tests to ensure the stability and reliability of the API.
I develop acceptance tests to validate the correct behavior of different operations.
Authentication:

I establish a secure authentication system to protect sensitive API operations.
I use token-based access control to ensure that only authorized users can perform modification operations.
Pagination:

I implement pagination to handle large sets of product data, allowing clients to request a specific number of results per page.
Documentation:

I create clear and comprehensive documentation using tools like Swagger or OpenAPI to assist other developers in the efficient and correct integration of the API.
Error Handling:

I implement a robust error-handling system with meaningful messages to facilitate debugging and issue resolution.
Logs:

I properly record events and actions performed in the API for log analysis, monitoring, and activity tracking.
Security:

I adopt security best practices, such as proper input validation, to prevent vulnerabilities.
I ensure protection against common attacks, such as SQL injection and code injection.
